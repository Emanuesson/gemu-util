# gemu-util

General Information
===================

Contains some utility-functions for the development of glib- and gtk+-apps

The functions are not exported as a stand-alone-library but rather just some C-files and header that can be included in existing projects and simply customized if necessary.

Documentation
=============

The public functions should be fully documented by GTK-doc comments. There are minimum-examples in the beginning of the source-files too.
